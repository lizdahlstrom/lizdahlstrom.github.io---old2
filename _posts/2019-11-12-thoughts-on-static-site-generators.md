Static site generators (SSG's) are tools widely used to quickly and easily generate deployable websites.

In comparison to building your own project from scratch, SSG's offer a set structure that can be easily maintainable and customizible as you wish. I think SSG's are great if you want to get started quickly without having to bother with setting up a base structure.

Something that can be otherwise tedious when creating a static website is duplicating global content (like navigation or footer) or similar content (like blog posts). SSG's generate this type of content with the help of templates and markdown. 

When collaborating on a project I can see a major advantage with using a SSG as the structure is already set up. It does not only save time from a developer point of view, but it also saves you from "weird" structuring decisions and time spent trying to understand how other developers have reasoned.
