Static site generators (SSG's) are tools widely used to quickly and easily generate deployable websites.

### Structure out of the box
In comparison to building your own project from scratch, SSG's offer a set structure that can be easily maintainable and customizible as you wish. I think SSG's are great if you want to get started quickly without having to bother with setting up a base structure.

### Templates
Something that can be otherwise tedious when creating a static website is duplicating global content (like navigation or footer) or similar content (like blog posts). SSG's generate this type of content with the help of templates and markdown. 

### Collaboration
When collaborating on a project I can see a major advantage with using a SSG as the structure and documentation is already set up. It does not only save time from a developer point of view, but it also saves you from "weird" organisation decisions and time spent trying to understand how other developers have reasoned when setting up the project.

## In conclusion...
SSG's are really cool tools. They certainly speed up the process of setting up a static website. When it comes to Jekyll, the learning curve is not very steep and with the amount of themes and templates available it should, as a developer, be fairly easy to build any static website you would like. That being said, for larger static websites you might want to use a CMS.
